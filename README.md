# Brexit_Referendum
Did social and political biases affect the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum. 
A machine learning approach.
This project uses common machine learning techniques to try and identify the variables that affected the Brexit Referendum. Some machine learning techniques are not ideal for this analysis but have been presented to demonstrate why this technique is not appropriate with the current dataset. The project draws some useful conclusions.
